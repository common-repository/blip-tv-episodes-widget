Blip TV Episodes plugin will allow you to setup a video widget, easily add videos to posts then watch them appear in the sidebar when viewing that post.

== Description ==

Blip TV Episodes Widget will dynamically check if your post or page has one or more Blip TV videos assigned to it. When a video url is found the plugin will embed the video in your 
sidebar for viewing. If no video is found, AdSense can be displayed instead so that your not wasting the space. There is an interface which lists all post and has the ability to 
paste a video url then save it to a post. Thats a little quicker than actually opening posts then saving videos into the custom fields. There is also an interface which lists all
exists posts that have videos, plus lists the videos under each post for deletion etc. The plugin is new for June 2010, many upgrades coming to help you manage your Blip TV
episodes and maximise use of the videos you spend hours creating.

== Installation ==

Standard Wordpress upload.

Add a custom field named "bliptvid" to your post and paste the bliptv video ID into the value or use the interface to add videos to each post.
